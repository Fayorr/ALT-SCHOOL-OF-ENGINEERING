			<h1>Ofada Rice and Sauce</h1>
			<p>
				<strong>Ayamase Stew</strong> is a traditional Nigerian green pepper
				stew known for its distinctive smoky flavor and greenish color. Made
				with green bell peppers, scotch bonnet peppers, palm oil, locust beans
				(iru), and assorted meats or fish, it has a rich, spicy taste with
				earthy undertones. The stew gets its characteristic appearance from the
				blended green peppers and its bold flavor from the fermented locust
				beans. Often called <i>"<u>Designer Stew</u>"</i> in Lagos, Ayamase is
				typically served with ofada rice and is popular for its authentic,
				rustic taste that represents traditional Yoruba cuisine.

				<h2><u>Instructions:</u></h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Place a big pot on a hob on medium heat, pour in palm oil, enough
						quantity to fry your meats. Leave to bleach for 15-10 minutes
						thereabouts, when the oil is bleached,
					</li>
					<li>
						Pour in your meats and fry till slightly crisp. When they’re all
						fried, scoop out the meat and side aside.
					</li>
					<li>
						Now you need at least a cup of Palm oil. Use the same Palm oil used
						for frying the meats. If you’ve got up to a cup, that’s fine if not,
						add more. Leave the pot on the hob.
					</li>
					<li>Add the onions. Sauté till fragrant…</li>
					<li>
						Now add the locust beans(Iru), sauté till it releases its flavour
						and aroma….
					</li>
					<li>
						Now add the crayfish, be careful not to add too much so it doesn’t
						overpower the authentic Ayamashe aroma, also add the shredded
						Stockfish…
					</li>
					<li>Fry for 2-3 minutes, then add the blended green pepper…</li>
					<li>
						Stir to combine, add the knorr cubes and salt to taste. Be careful
						not to add too much seasoning as you’ll be adding stock later on…
					</li>
					<li>
						Now cover and let this fry till oil floats to the top. Do check
						every now and then to prevent burning.
					</li>
					<li>When oil flows to the top, Now add the fried meat.</li>
					<li>
						You can add the stock if you find the consistency too thick as palm
						oil has a tendency to thicken soups up. Cook for a further 8-10
						minutes.
					</li>
					<li>
						Switch off the heat and let it simmer with the residual heat, at
						this time, the oil will float to the top. And it’s done..
					</li>
					<li>
						Serve with Ofada rice or any kind of cooked white rice, fried
						plantain or even yam….
					</li>
