		<p>
			I am an aspiring Frontend Engineer with a strong drive for building
			dynamic, user-focused web experiences. My interest in web development was
			born from a love for interactive websites and the critical thinking
			required to bring ideas to life through code.
			<br />
			<br />
			I hold a degree in Mechanical Engineering from the prestigious Obafemi
			Awolowo University and have since transitioned fully into tech to pursue
			my passion. To gain globally relevant skills and accelerate my growth, I
			enrolled in the School of Engineering at AltSchool Africa, where I am
			actively learning JavaScript and modern frontend frameworks.
			<br />
			<br />
			I’m committed to creating innovative and impactful solutions while
			contributing meaningfully to any team or organization I represent. I
			aspire not only to be a valuable developer but also to take on leadership
			roles that drive growth and excellence. Curious by nature, I enjoy
			thinking deeply, reading, writing, and exploring the world in search of
			meaningful insights. I am especially passionate about seeing young people
			rise and thrive in spaces once considered out of reach..
